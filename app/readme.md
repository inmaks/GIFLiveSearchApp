# GIFLiveSearch

This app is written mostly in Jetpack Compose, it uses materail3 and latest experimental LazyStagerredGrid.
Because of that, app will work only on Android 13(SDK 33) or later versions.

Current known bugs:
- Sometimes search doesn't trigger on last entered letter (couldn't reproduce it constantly to know the exact reason).
- Sometimes when searching for new gifs, grid doesn't scroll all the way up.

Here is small video that will help You understand main concept:
